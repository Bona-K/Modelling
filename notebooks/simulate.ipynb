    "### Spillover & Complementary Capture\n",
    "\n",
    "_How an anchor store drives spillover and how complementary stores capture that flow in a mall network_\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objective**  \n",
    "To see how simple local rules create realistic **footfall** and **sales** patterns.  \n",
    "This project quantifies how **(1) anchor quality** and **(2) the category composition** of surrounding stores affect:\n",
    "- Customer movement patterns (diffusion from the anchor), and  \n",
    "- The spatial distribution of sales across the mall network.\n",

    "| **Component** | **Description** |\n",
    "|---------------:|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Nodes** | Stores (1 anchor + multiple tenants). Each node has a category ∈ {`similar`, `complementary`, `different`} and a quality weight **A**. |\n",
    "| **Edges** | Spatial adjacency between stores, undirected (`p_edge = 0.2`). |\n",
    "| **Agents** | 100 shoppers initially placed at the **anchor** (`A₀`). |\n",
    "| **Time** | `1 tick = 15 min`; `10 steps ≈ 2.5 hours` total stay. |\n",

    "### **Core Assumptions**\n",
    "- Customers start shopping at the **anchor store (node 0)**.\n",
    "- Each agent continues moving for a limited time (`10` steps ≈ `2.5` hours total stay), then exits.\n",
    "- The **anchor quality** determines initial attraction strength:  \n",
    "  - **High** quality → strong crowding, less diffusion  \n",
    "  - **Medium** quality → balanced spread  \n",
    "  - **Low** quality → weak attraction, flat network\n",
    "- Purchases occur mainly at **anchor** and **complementary** stores, reflecting co-shopping behavior.\n",
